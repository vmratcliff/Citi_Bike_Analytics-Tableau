The objective of this exercise is to create a dashboard to provide data reports for the [New York Citi Bike Program](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).

A time span of 2 years for the months January 2018-December 2019 was chosen and a set of data reports are generated using Tableau. These reports aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Log to provide answers to city officials on the program as follows:
* A dashboard for each phenomena and the dashboards are accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring.
* Basic - A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
* Advanced - A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) with zip code data overlaid on the map.

A Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, maps and dashboard can be found here: [Tableau Story Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/profile/veronica.r5580#!/vizhome/CitiBikeAnalysis20182019/STORY-CitiBikeAnalytics)
